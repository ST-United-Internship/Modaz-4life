                                    We’re super quick at processing orders to make sure that you receive them as soon as possible. You can change your order as much as you like before you click “Check- out” but after this point you will be unable to make changes to your order. Keep in mind our system is designed to fulfill orders as quickly as possible. We cannot cancel or change an order once it has been placed. In such case you can however, return the item to us in accordance with our Returns Policy. If we sent out your package and your items are returned to us (Packages marked "Return to Sender") due to an incorrect/undeliverable address, we will issue a store credit for the net total minus the shipping fee. You will be held responsible for the initial cost of shipping the package.
